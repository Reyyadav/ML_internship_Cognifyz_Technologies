# Internship Experience - Rahul R Yadav
## Machine Learning Intern

## Overview

***During my internship, I worked on a series of machine learning and data analysis tasks focused on the restaurant industry. The objective was to leverage data to predict restaurant ratings, build a recommendation system, classify cuisines, and conduct location-based analysis. Below is an outline of the tasks and the key takeaways from each.***

# Tasks Completed

## Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratings
***Objective: To build a machine learning model that predicts the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features.***

### Steps:

- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and split the data into training and testing sets.
- Model Selection: Chose a Decision Tree Regressor for its ability to capture complex relationships within the data.
- Model Training: Trained the model on the processed dataset.

### Evaluation:
- MSE: Achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.05, indicating highly accurate predictions with minimal errors.
- R² Value: The model achieved an R² value of 0.98, showcasing its effectiveness in explaining and predicting the target variable.
- Result: The Decision Tree Regressor performed exceptionally well on the test data, demonstrating strong predictive capability.


## Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation
***Objective: To create a recommendation system that suggests restaurants based on user preferences.***

### Steps:

- Data Preprocessing: Addressed missing values and encoded categorical variables.
- Criteria Determination: Established criteria for recommendations, such as cuisine preference and price range.
- Recommendation System: Implemented a content-based filtering approach to recommend restaurants similar to the user’s preferred criteria.

### Evaluation:

- Quality of Recommendations: The system is designed to recommend the top 5 restaurants with ratings of 4 and above, ensuring that the recommendations are both relevant and highly rated.


## Task 3: Cuisine Classification
***Objective: To develop a machine learning model that classifies restaurants based on their cuisine types.***

### Steps:

- Data Preprocessing: Managed missing values and encoded categorical variables.
- Model Selection: Chose Random Forest and Logistic Regression as classification algorithms.
- Model Training: Trained both models on the processed dataset.

### Evaluation:
- Model Comparison: Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression in terms of classification accuracy, demonstrating better performance in identifying the correct cuisine types.


## Task 4: Location-based Analysis
***Objective: To conduct a geographical analysis of restaurants in the dataset.***

### Steps:

- Data Exploration: Analyzed the latitude and longitude coordinates and visualized the distribution of restaurants on a map.
- Grouping and Analysis: Grouped restaurants by city/locality and analyzed the concentration of restaurants, along with average ratings, cuisines, and price ranges.

### Insights:

- The analysis revealed patterns in restaurant distribution, average ratings, cuisine popularity, and diversity across different locations.
- It provided actionable insights into how geography influences restaurant characteristics and customer preferences.

## Key Learnings

- Machine Learning Techniques: Gained hands-on experience with various regression and classification algorithms, along with their practical applications in real-world datasets.
- Data Preprocessing: Improved skills in handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and preparing datasets for model training.
- Model Evaluation: Learned how to evaluate models using metrics like MSE, R², accuracy, precision, and recall, and how to interpret these results for business applications.
- Geographical Analysis: Developed an understanding of how to visualize and analyze location-based data to uncover trends and patterns.


## Conclusion
***This internship provided a comprehensive experience in applying machine learning and data analysis techniques to a practical problem domain. The tasks completed not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of how to derive meaningful insights from data.***
